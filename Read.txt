Everyone gets sad sometimes; it’s a part of being human. But feeling sad for a long period of time makes life really hard and isn’t good for your overall health.

Here are some signs that sadness is taking over your life:

You’ve stopped seeing friends and family.
You get angry easily.
You get emotional and/or cry for no apparent reason.
You’ve stopped caring about stuff that used to interest you.
You’re sleeping more, or less, than you used to.
You’re eating more, or less, than you used to.
You’re finding it hard to do all the things you used to do (such as work or chores).
